            <h1>Web Technology</h1>
            <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for 
                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is frequently assisted 
                by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the 
                documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically 
                and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

            <h1>C Programming</h1>
            <p>C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing 
                firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was 
                developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.
                Ranked among the most widely used languages, C has a compiler for most computer systems and 
                has influenced many popular languages notably C++.C is a high-level and general-purpose programming

            <h1>Java</h1>
            <p>Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on 
                billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles,
                devices and many others. The rules and syntax of Java are based on the C and C++ languages.
                One major advantage of developing software with Java is its portability. Once you have written 
                code for a Java program on a notebook computer, it is very easy to move the code to a mobile device.
                When the language was invented in 1991 by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (later acquired by 
                Oracle), the primary goal was to be able to "write once, run anywhere."
